#' Geodesic distance vertex similarity
#'
#' This function calculates similarity score for vertices based on the
#'   shortest paths between them.
#'
#' Geodesic distance between vertices is the length of the shortest paths
#'   between them. If there is no path between vertices (ie. thay are in
#'   different connected components), a geodesic distance is set to the number
#'   of vertices in the graph plus one. Distances are inversed afterwards, so as
#'   two vertices are more similar when the distances between them is shorter.
